    Fifty roses around my throne
    My girl found me there alone.
    Candles sweet exhale aroma.
    Wax in dale of her stomach.
    Gentle music reach our ears.
    I beseech you to break atmosphere.

    Romantic defecation.
    I see, what you ate today.
    I feel the magic relation.
    And I'll pay you without delay.
    
    you feel it?
    you smell it?
    
    The burst is closer than you ever thought.
    i'm flying through prejudices like astronaut.
    She waits me in the room of pleasure
    with yellow walls and the brown blazer.
    Let me put it on. Do it gently.
    hand in sleeve, ass in pants. think it's aptly?

    второй куплет + проигрыш перед вторым припевом.
    на брейкдаун и на ускорении две вокальные фразы:
    you feel it?
    you smell it?
