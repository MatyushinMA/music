The doors are closed up,
The flophouse is ulltry clear.
Except the moth under the lamp.
And innkeeper with bottle of beer.
One gear in clocks were broken,
Then other one came along.
Rusted sun in the sky is the token.
That we suddenly turned all alone.
Numb fingers are trying to catch
Smth you never thought to find.
Lock that door with old wooden latch.
The flophouse will close at nine.
