You are the rats.
On the stars dump.
You live in guts and nets.
And Gnawing dicks in cunt.
The clatter of your god
I felt while flying down.
My mug was stained in mud.
It makes my father frown.
I growed up in hell,
And now I'm here again.
I wanna hear you yell.
Before I go to slay.

This broder is so sly.
Does it gonna curb my vengeance.
Do water-suicide.
Or beat my intransigence.

Holes in hands.
Hurt to jerk off.
Now I'm man
Who spend the sexless epoch.
I saw it million times,
When you burn down from lust.
It caused many crimes.
My eyes were covered rust.
And i will fuck your kids,
And reap their limbs to jell.
I'm waiting for your bids
To make me hear you yell.

//This needs correcting
